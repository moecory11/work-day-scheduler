# work-day-scheduler
## Description
For this project my motivation was to create a day planner that correctly color coded events based on real time throught the day. The day planner will be user friendly and operates smoothly. I learned throught the creating of this day planner the importance of keeping everything organized. Not only with the day planner itself, but organized with the code in it.
## Installation
To access the HTML, CSS and JS you can go to the GitHub repository for this project:
https://github.com/moecory11/work-day-scheduler
## Usage
When using this day planner you have acces to the dae and time displayed in the header of the planner. The day is layed out for you to add and delete events between 8am and 5pm. Also, the color coding of each hour will reflect past, current and future time based on the date/time feature on the page. At this time the color coding is not operational, but will be corrected.

## Credits
While creating this project my main source of references and resources came from the examples and activities in my daily class content.
